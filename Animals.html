            <h3>Lions Reproduction</h3>
            <p>Mating take place at most times of the year and a male may mate with several females. A lioness has cubs about every two years and gestation is 105 - 112 days. Shortly before birth, she chooses a suitable place for her lair, which ideally should be out of sight from predators,
                 sheltered and close to water.</p>
